When a parser succeeds, we have a parse tree.
For each character in the input, there is a stack of parser rules which that character successfully matched.

For the entire parse there is a tree of nonterminals, with the nonterminal which matched the entire string as the root, and the terminal symbols (or sometimes strings of them) as leaves.

When a parse fails, there may be a parse tree covering some prefix of the input.
There is some first terminal symbol which was unparseable.
There is some set of parse rules which were tried at that parse position and all of which failed.
(There may also have been some which succeeded.)
There may be a set of rules which succeeded, rules which failed, and rules which were not tried.
There must be one rule which was the last rule to be tried at that position and the last to fail.
