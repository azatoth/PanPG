----------

In the streaming parser we assign certain flags to each expression, which determines whether the parser stores the current position, starts buffering child nodes, etc, when it enters that expression and when the expression matches or fails.

Here is a snippet of diagnostic output from the generator:

{Expr:{S:1
      ,name:"Expr"
      ,expr:{id:"Expr+0"
            ,S:1
            ,T:28672
            ,M:41
            ,F:42
            ,type:2
            ,toplevel:true
            ,flag_n:172
            ,flags:{cache:false
                   ,t_bufferout:false
                   ,pushpos:true
                   ,t_emitstate:true
                   ,m_emitstate:false
                   ,m_emitclose:true
                   ,m_emitanon:false
                   ,m_emitlength:true
                   ,m_resetpos:false
                   ,m_emitbuf:false
                   ,m_tossbuf:false
                   ,f_tossbuf:false}
            ,S_flags:4268
            ,S_flags_:"1000010101100"
            ,subexprs:[{id:"Expr+1"
                       ,S:7
                       ,T:8364

For each expression, the T, M, and F states are set, these are the states the parser will transition to when the expression is tested, matches, or fails, respectively.
The complement of flags are:

cache
t_bufferout
pushpos
t_emitstate
m_emitstate
m_emitclose
m_emitanon
m_emitlength
m_resetpos
m_emitbuf
m_tossbuf
f_tossbuf

All of these flags are currently provided by the caller to the code generator, and to enable streaming at least some of the streamable expressions will probably have to be designated by the caller.
Ultimately these can be derived from the grammar by an analyzer.
In the meantime we would like to assign reasonable defaults for each flag that will give correct results.

Defaults should be safe for all expressions, then we can add increasingly fine-grained tuning for performance.

cache: true for Rule top-level exprs
t_bufferout: for the first subexpr of a sequence, for any lookahead, and whenever `cache` is set[1,2]
pushpos: anything with m_emitlength set[3], anything that can fail without failing the containing expression, any lookahead
t_emitstate: any rule that is entered in streaming mode[5]
m_emitstate: rule for which t_emitstate is not set
m_emitclose: union of t_emitstate and m_emitstate[8]
m_emitanon: definition of an expr that produces an anonymous node
m_emitlength: union of m_emitclose, m_emitanon
m_resetpos: positive lookaheads only
m_emitbuf: commit points corresponding to a preceding t_bufferout[9,10]
m_tossbuf: positive lookaheads only[11]
f_tossbuf: sequence subexprs before a commit point[12]

[1] turning this on for the sequence, instead of the first subexpr, would be just as good
[2] t_bufferout can always be turned off if the expression can't generate any child nodes (bufferout should be called buffer_child_nodes since that is actually what it does)
[3] i.e. that emits a node, whether named or anon
[5] by default this will never be set, but some intelligence can be used to determine when this is and is not safe
[8] but not m_emitanon, since anon nodes are self-closing
[9] these and t_bufferout should be paired
[10] by default before doing any analysis, the commit point is the last expression in a sequence
[11] when a negative lookahead succeeds, the subexpr failed, which means it emitted no children and did not advance the position, so only positive lookaheads require m_resetpos and m_tossbuf (which can probably be combined)
[12] there may be more than one fail point per t_bufferout, but only one commit point

So, to find reasonable defaults:

cache: for top-level exprs of each named rule
t_bufferout: for top-level exprs[13], for the first subexpr of a (non-singleton) sequence, and for lookaheads
pushpos: for any top-level rule, any anonymous node, any lookahead, and any proper sequence[14]
t_emitstate: every top-level expr[15]
m_emitstate: never set[16]
m_emitclose: same as m_emitstate[18]
m_emitanon: true for anonymous nodes[19]
m_emitlength: union of m_emitstate (== m_emitclose) and m_emitanon
m_resetpos: positive lookaheads
m_emitbuf: top-level exprs, commit points, i.e. the last expression in a proper sequence (by default in lieu of any deeper analysis)
m_tossbuf: any lookahead
f_tossbuf: set on every subexpression of a proper sequence, and on any lookahead

[13] this is set because t_emitstate is currently set on every top-level expression, but this can be optimized
[14] pushpos also implies that the position is popped on match or failure (these could be separated if there were a need of course)
[15] "top-level" here means the expression at the top level of a rule (which is always a sequence in the v6 codegen)
[16] this could be set on rules which are streamable (i.e. don't buffer input) but can also fail without failing the entire parse; it is only suitable for rules which cannot have children, as otherwise the start will be emitted after the child nodes
[18] note that a rule must emit the start, then emit the child nodes, then emit the close, which means that m_emitstate, m_emitbuf, and m_emitclose must come in that order
[19] an anonymous expression is any expression that can emit an anonymous node, i.e. any expression which can match non-zero-length input and also can have at least one named rule sibling.

To determine which expressions are "anonymous expressions" (i.e. can generate an anonymous node) first we consider atomic expressions.
Once string literals are replaced with sequences of csets, there are only three kinds of atomic expressions: named references, csets, and ϵ.
Of these, named references can consume input, but always emit nodes, so the input that they consume is accounted for in the output stream.
The empty expression ϵ cannot consume input, and so never contributes an output node, and can be ignored here.
Character primitives, however, can consume input, but do not generate output nodes, so in some cases, anonymous nodes need to be generated in the output.
We can classify expressions as either 'consuming anonymously' or not.
Any character literal consumes anonymously.
Named references do not consume anonymously.
An ordered choice consumes anonymously (potentially) if any subexpression consumes anonymously.
A sequence consumes anonymously if it has at least one sub-expression which consumes anonymously, but does not have any named references.
If a sequence contains a named reference, and has a sub-expression which consumes anonymously, then that sub-expression is marked as anonymous-emitting, and the sequence itself does not consume anonymously.

In the case of mixed ordered choice, we can make all anonymously-consuming sub-expressions emit anonymous nodes.
The named references will not emit anonymous nodes.
The entire mixed ordered choice then becomes a non-anonymously-consuming and a can-emit-named-node expression.

So there are atomic expressions for which the choice is simple.
There are repetitions, which are anonymously consuming if the sub-expression is anonymously consuming, and otherwise not.
There are lookaheads, which never consume any input or emit any nodes.
Finally there are sequences and ordered choices which are the interesting cases.

Lookaheads and ϵ never emit nodes and never consume input, we will call these 'non-emitting, non-consuming'.
Character classes always consume and never emit named nodes, we call these 'anonymously consuming'.
Named references always emit nodes, we call these 'always emitting'.
Ordered choice productions can contain expressions which can emit named references but might emit nothing.
We call these last two together the 'can-emit-named' expressions, including any which always emit named nodes and those which sometimes do.
When a node would otherwise consume anonymously, but can have a named sibling, we cause it to emit an anonymous node.
Exactly one of these four classes (no-consume, anon-consume, can-emit-named, and anon-emit) should apply to any expression in any grammar.
This means that no can-emit-named expression can be permitted to consume anonymously.
This is the reason why this rule may introduce additional anonymous nodes that are strictly unnecessary.

The problem in the output is if there is a named node child node N1 which has no named node sibling, but is shorter than the parent node N2, then the output format becomes insufficient to determine the begin and end position of N1 within N2.
To prevent this problem we insert anonymous nodes into the output stream.

Example:

NegativeInteger ← "-" Digits

When parsing "-123" the desired parse tree is:

NegativeInteger 0-4
  anonymous 0-1
  Digits 1-4

If some extraneous anonymous nodes are produced in the output, that is an acceptable error.
The current bug is much worse and results in an incorrect tree.

The rules:

CharLit → anon-consume
ϵ → no-consume
Named → can-emit-named
Lookahead → no-consume
Repetition,
Sequence,
OrdC        → see below

A repetition is either can-emit-named, or anon-consume, according to the type of its subexpression.

A sequence of only can-emit-named, and no-consume is can-emit-named.
A sequence of only anon-consume and no-consume is anon-consume.
Otherwise the sequence is mixed.
Without intervention such a sequence would be able to emit either named nodes or consume anonymously, which we do not allow.
Therefore in such a case we set each anon-consume subexpr to anon-emit.
This becomes a sequence of anon-emit and can-emit-named, which becomes itself a can-emit-named expression.
Because of this rule, no can-emit-named expression will ever consume anonymously.

Observations:
A no-consume sub-expression has no effect on the type of the parent and can be ignored.
There will never be an anon-emit expression unless created by this algorithm (they do not arise from the properties of atomic elements but from the ways in which they are combined) so there will never be a sequence which contains an anon-emit without a can-emit-named.

An ordered choice of only can-emit-named or no-consume becomes can-emit-named.
An ordered choice of only anon-consume or no-consume becomes anon-consume.
(This means that an expression marked 'anon-consume' can also succeed without consuming, which is why before emitting an anonymous node we test for non-zero length.)
Otherwise the ordered choice is mixed.
Without intervention, a mixed ordered choice could consume anonymously or it could emit a named node.
This would be fine in some circumstances, however, it breaks the desired constraint that we can determine, at compile time, which of the four categories each expression is in.
If we desired to maintain this information at runtime, by keeping track of which sub-expression succeeded, we could eliminate some unnecessary anonymous nodes, however, we prefer the solution which makes the runtime behavior per expression deterministic, regardless of how that expression came to succeed.
We handle a mixed ordered choice similarly to a mixed sequence.
Each sub-expression which is marked anon-consume, is changed to anon-emit.
The entire OrdC then becomes can-emit-named, and the constraint that every can-emit-named expression 'looks after' what it consumes (i.e. generates nodes that fully cover the input it matches) is preserved.

We would also like to be sure that no anonymous node can ever be emitted as a child of another anonymous node.
To verify this, we consider that only anon-emit expressions ever emit anonymous nodes, and anon-emit nodes are only created as children of an OrdC or a sequence which also has a can-emit-named sub-expression.
Any OrdC or sequence which has at least one can-emit-named sub-expression, will become a can-emit-named expression itself.
Therefore the parent of every anon-emit expression will be a can-emit-named expression, and since that can-emit-named expression can never emit an anonymous node, we can be satisfied.

The current implementation:

anon-consume
no-consume (does not affect parent and does not need to appear in code)
can-emit-named
anon-emit

So the two ways of assigning t_bufferout and m_emitbuf and f_tossbuf were not compatible.
...actually that's not quite obvious to me.

So the issue is what happens with rules that do not contain a proper sequence at top level, but which have t_emitstate set (as all rules currently do).
Example:
S ← " "+
This becomes:
S ← (seq U+0020 (rep U+0020))
The full derived rule given by the current codegen:
S ← (S+0 seq (S+1 seq (S+2 cset 20) (S+3 rep (S+4 cset 20))))
There is an extra sequence at the top, which is a quirk of the simplification rules.
We can do away with this.

So the issue is:
When a rule is entered, the t_emitstate prevents the rule from coming after any children.
If the rule is a proper sequence, we t_bufferout (this should just be called t_pushbuf).
In this case, if the rule fails, the t_emitstate will get thrown away with the buf, by f_tossbuf on the sequence sub-expr which fails.
But, if the top-level expr is not a proper sequence (as in S here), then when it is entered, the state gets pushed onto the existing buf, and then, even if the rule fails, there is no f_tossbuf, nor can there be since there was no corresponding t_pushbuf (nee t_bufferout).

One solution is to have the pushbuf on the rule and on every proper sequence.
This is the current solution, but it is not implemented correctly.
Sequences need to have t_bufferout and m_emitbuf and f_tossbuf set.
What if the subexpressions don't have any of these set and only proper sequences do the buffering?
And top-level rules.
This is inefficient (lots of needless buffering) but it should be correct.
It does completely kill streaming however, but streaming needs to be added in with another analysis phase anyway.
So, let's try to make this work, inefficient or not.

When both cache and buffering flags are set on the same expression (as for top-level expressions) the order of operations matters.
When entering an expression, the result may be pulled from the cache.
If it is, it needs to have the same effect on the buffer state as if it had been actually played out rather than pulled from cache.
When the result is known, the same buffer operations will be performed, whether the result came from the cache or not.

We should admit the possibility of any combination of cache and buffering flags being set: either, neither, or both, without creating an erroneous parser.
If there is no buffering, but there is a cache:
when the ...
ok, no.
caching implies buffering, because the thing stored in the cache includes the buffer of child contents if any, and we currently only have one kind of caching (cache-all, as oppsed to cache-pos which works only when a node cannot have children).
only if we ever cache "bachelor" nodes then this case might become relevant
so if there is buffering but no cache, everything currently works
if there is buffering and a cache:
- when the expr is entered, t_bufferout implies that we always push a buffer, whether it is coming from the cache or not
... so we just need to set t_bufferout itself whenever cache is set, which I already had written in the first set of rules above, and subsequently changed my mind about somehow by the secend set...
... no, that's also wrong.  The flags generated by the code, and the second set of rules, are correct, the problem is in the order
