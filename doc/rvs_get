To create a local copy of the source using rvs_get, first download it and make it executable, then point it at the project root.

It looks for a project_files file in the directory you point it at, and then downloads the files listed there.

It will create a local PanPG directory (or another directory if you pass the name as the second argument) but it will not do anything if that directory already exists.
So you can use this to download the current source, but any merging with your own local modifications you'll have to do yourself.

wget http://boshi.inimino.org/3box/revstore/rvs_get
chmod +x rvs_get
./rvs_get http://boshi.inimino.org/3box/PanPG/

Or in one line:

curl -sS http://boshi.inimino.org/3box/revstore/rvs_get | sh -s http://boshi.inimino.org/3box/PanPG/

You can also download the v0.0.6 release, rather than the latest code, with:

./rvs_get http://boshi.inimino.org/3box-asof/1282000000000/PanPG/
