To create a local copy of the source using rvs_get, download it and run it like so:

wget http://boshi.inimino.org/3box/revstore/rvs_get
chmod +x rvs_get
./rvs_get http://boshi.inimino.org/3box/PanPG/

Or in one line:

curl -sS http://boshi.inimino.org/3box/revstore/rvs_get | sh -s http://boshi.inimino.org/3box/PanPG/
It will create a local PanPG directory (or any another directory name you provide as the second argument).
It will complain and exit if that directory already exists.
So you can use this to download the current tree, but it won't overwrite an existing tree, and any merging with your own local modifications you'll have to do yourself.

By pointing it at the development directory you will get the latest code.
You can also download the v0.0.6 release instead, with:

./rvs_get http://boshi.inimino.org/3box-asof/1282000000000/PanPG/
