notes on deterministic finite automata

A DFA is a 5-tuple (Q, Σ, δ, q₀, F)

Q is a set of states,
Σ is the alphabet,
δ is the transition function Q × Σ → Q,
q₀ is the start state, and
F is the set of accepting states (F ⊆ Q)

We wish to opportunistically construct a set of DFAs matching a regular part of a PEG when it is likely to improve the efficiency of the parser.
