<h1>PanPG</h1>

<p>
PanPG is a parser generator.
Input is a parser expression grammar (PEG) and output is a JavaScript parser.

<h2>Grammar Reuse</h2>

<p>
PanPG uses plain PEG grammar files without embedded code.
The same grammar file should be equally usable by a compiler, a syntax highlighter running in real time in a text editor, a static analysis tool, etc.
All of these will need to process the parsed representation in different ways; the code should not be part of the grammar.
Embedded code also needlessly ties the grammar to a single implementation language.

<p>
PanPG uses the PEG formalism, which is inherently composable; this supports reuse of grammars and grammar components.
PanPG supports incremental alterations of a base grammar by passing grammar patches, which override specific parse rules, to the parser generator.

<h2>No Separate Lexer</h2>

<p>
The PEG formalism is sufficiently powerful that there is no need for a separate lexing or tokenizing stage.
There is only one formalism to learn, and the grammar uses the same primitives and operators (and can support the same visualization and debugging tools) "all the way down" â€” from the top-level rule to the individual characters that make up each token.

<p>
Lexers written using dedicated tools or by hand can be very fast, and a fair amount of analysis must be done on a PEG to derive similar performance optimizations.
This work is just getting started, and currently PanPG generates slower parsers than many other parser generators available for JavaScript.
The benefits of a simpler grammar may outweigh the current performance limitations for some applications, such as language prototyping.

<h2>Unicode Support</h2>

<p>
JavaScript Unicode support is somewhat marginal, for example JavaScript regexes do not transparently support the full Unicode range.
PanPG does support the full Unicode range, and transparently handles UTF-16, which is what JavaScript strings are.
UTF-8 support is planned, this would be useful with non-standard JavaScript string representations, such as the buffer and byte array representations now arising in server-side JavaScript and elsewhere.
